But some supervexxens_datapacks that effect others will be effected by the friends list. For exsample: You have a superpower that weakens all near you, but you dont want your friends too be weakened? Well add them too your friends list and they wont be! Simple as that. Too add a friend too the friends list, simply do:\n- \"/trigger add_friend set (player id)\"\nNow you may say, whats a player id? Well too get the player id, simply press tab, and you may see a number there, however this is only true if a setting is enabled, if that does not work, do:\n- \"/trigger list_player_ids\" \nThis will give you the player name, and there id. \n\nNow too remove a friend do: \n- \"trigger remove_friend set (player id)\"\n\nToo see a list of all your online friends do:\n- \"/trigger list_friends\"\n\nNow for admins, too enable/disable the player id appering in tab, do:\n- \"/trigger SOO_gamerules\" while in creative mode.\n\n "}]
