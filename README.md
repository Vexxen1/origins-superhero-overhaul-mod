Welcome to Origins Superhero Overhaul by Vexxen. This is the mod version. My discord name is Vexxen#0725, and my discord is https://discord.gg/T3xwZDUd9Z. My planet Minecraft is https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/vexxen0725/. Origins Superhero Overhaul replaces origins with randomly chosen superpowers. But you can choose the theme of the superpower, for example attacking, or defense. There are many superpowers to choose from. 40 to be exact. There are 4 grades of superpowers. Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Epic. When a power is one of a kind, it goes up a grade. When a power is one of a kind, it will have the same chance of its true grade, but only one person can get it, and once they have it, no one can get it again till they lose it. They lose it if they don't log in for one month. 
	The chances of getting each rarity are 50% for common, 30% for uncommon, 20% for rare. You can reroll with an orb. You can get a orb sometimes in end city loot, but it's very rare. You can also find neutral power powder in end city loot that can be used by a person with the crafting master superpower to craft orbs. 
	There are many new and interesting items that can be crafted by the crafting master. But there are a few interesting items that can be crafted by anyone. Specifically, netherite horse armor, power crystals, and blazing arrows. Blazing arrows are arrows that explode on impact, do more damage, and have infinite piercing. 
	Power Crystals can absorb specific powers when held, and the power is used. When they absorb a power, they can be placed on the ground and will absorb blaze powerder thrown near them. When absorbed, it will activate the power. Some powers require a stack of blaze powder to activate, and some use the blaze powder like fuel. 
	In the same vein, blaze powder can absorb specific powers when held, and the power is used. They will become power powder when they absorb the power, and different powers do different things. Other players can use power powder to recreate the ability in the powder, and use a powder up. 
	The friends list is a system that is used to mark your friends, and foes. Specific powers use the friends list. For example, heal your friends when you press primary. 
	Anyway, enjoy. This data pack is best used on servers, but works fine in single player. It's made for 1.19+, fabric. Don't use this pack if you don't have good hardware. Incompatible with most datapacks. The mods needed to run this pack are:
- Origins
- Pekui

The mods that improve this datapack:
- Gravity API: For the spider and reverse gravity superpowers
- Chunk loader: An item that can only be crafted by the crafting master.
